The Deimos Manifesto
------------------

Deimos is a collection of C header files to publicly available C libraries
and their translations to D. The idea is that if, in C, to interface to a library
one would write:

   #include "foo.h"

then the corresponding D code would look like:

   import foo;

or:

   import deimos.foo;

Each C .h file would have a corresponding .d file. Each C directory would
have a corresponding D directory, for example:

   #include "bar/foo.h"   // C

   import bar.foo; // D

The top level directory of each library will have this subdirectory:

   C/

in which will be the C .h files corresponding to the D ones, so that they can
be easily compared.
There will be a one-to-one correspondence of files and directory structure
between the C and D versions.
Do not insert any C files whose license will not permit it.

The D import files will be a rote translation of the corresponding C .h file.
No attempt will be made to fix, improve, refactor or extend the C api. No attempt will
be made to duplicate the C documentation, or replace it in any way. There
will be no unittests. Every effort will be made to avoid needing any D specific
binary files.

When an updated version of the C header files becomes available, those will
get checked into the C subdirectory tree, and then the corresponding D files
will get updated.

If different versions of the C APIs are supported, they will be done as branches
and the branches must be tagged with the same versioning scheme used by the C API files.

The license used for the D versions should match the C ones, as they are a
derived work.

Examples can be found in the examples directory.
