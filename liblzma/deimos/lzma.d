 * \brief       The public API of liblzma data compression library
 *
 * liblzma is a public domain general-purpose data compression library with
 * a zlib-like API. The native file format is .xz, but also the old .lzma
 * format and raw (no headers) streams are supported. Multiple compression
 * algorithms (filters) are supported. Currently LZMA2 is the primary filter.
 *
 * liblzma is part of XZ Utils <http://tukaani.org/xz/>. XZ Utils includes
 * a gzip-like command line tool named xz and some other tools. XZ Utils
 * is developed and maintained by Lasse Collin.
 *
 * Major parts of liblzma are based on Igor Pavlov's public domain LZMA SDK
 * <http://7-zip.org/sdk.html>.
 *
 * The SHA-256 implementation is based on the public domain code found from
 * 7-Zip <http://7-zip.org/>, which has a modified version of the public
 * domain SHA-256 code found from Crypto++ <http://www.cryptopp.com/>.
 * The SHA-256 code in Crypto++ was written by Kevin Springle and Wei Dai.
